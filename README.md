## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- virtualenv (recommended)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-preprocessing-python.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd nlp-preprocessing-python

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv nlp-env

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
nlp-env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source nlp-env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. 🔠 Lowercasing
- Convert all text to lowercase for normalization
- Reduce vocabulary size and improve consistency

### 2. 🚫 Removing Stop Words
- Eliminate common words (e.g., "the", "is", "and")
- Focus on meaningful content words

### 3. 🔍 Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Pattern matching for text cleaning
- Extract specific text patterns
- Remove unwanted characters and formatting

### 4. ✂️ Tokenization
- Split text into words, sentences, or subwords
- Word tokenization and sentence segmentation

### 5. 🌱 Stemming
- Reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" → "run")
- Algorithmic approach using Porter, Snowball stemmers

### 6. 🍃 Lemmatization
- Linguistically informed word root reduction
- More accurate than stemming (e.g., "better" → "good")

### 7. 🔗 N-Grams
- Generate word sequences (bigrams, trigrams)
- Capture context and phrase information

## 🛠️ Installation

Detailed installation instructions:

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

# Download NLTK data
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('wordnet')"
```

---

## 💻 Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute cells sequentially:

```python
# Example code snippet for text preprocessing
from nlp_preprocessing import TextPreprocessor

processor = TextPreprocessor()
processed_text = processor.clean_text("Your raw text goes here!")
print(processed_text)
```
