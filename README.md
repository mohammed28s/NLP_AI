✨ New Features
This update introduces advanced NLP analysis on a real-world dataset:

🧠 Named Entity Recognition (NER): Automatically identify and classify key information (people, organizations, locations) in news articles.

📖 Parts-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Analyze the grammatical structure of sentences to understand language patterns.

📰 Real-World Data: All techniques are demonstrated on the bbc_news.csv dataset, containing real news articles from the BBC.

📚 All Topics Covered
1. Text Preprocessing
Technique	Description	Example
🔠 Lowercasing	Convert text to lowercase for normalization	"Hello World" → "hello world"
🚫 Stop Words Removal	Eliminate common words that add little meaning	"the quick brown fox" → "quick brown fox"
🔍 Regular Expressions	Clean text and extract patterns using Regex	"Price: $25.99" → "25.99"
✂️ Tokenization	Split text into words or sentences	"Hello world!" → ["Hello", "world", "!"]
🌱 Stemming	Reduce words to their root form (algorithmic)	"running" → "run"
🍃 Lemmatization	Reduce words to their dictionary base form (linguistic)	"better" → "good"
🔗 N-Grams	Generate word sequences for context analysis	"natural language processing" → ["natural language", "language processing"]
2. Advanced NLP Analysis
Technique	Description	Example
🧠 Named Entity Recognition (NER)	Identify and classify named entities	"Apple is located in Cupertino." → [('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Cupertino', 'LOC')]
📖 Parts-of-Speech (POS) Tagging	Label words with their grammatical parts	"She runs quickly" → [('She', 'PRP'), ('runs', 'VBZ'), ('quickly', 'RB')]
🗃️ Dataset
The project uses the bbc_news.csv dataset. This dataset contains:

Contents: News articles from the BBC across different categories (e.g., business, politics, tech).

Use Case: Perfect for demonstrating NLP techniques on real, unstructured text data.

Columns: Likely includes article_id, category, text, etc.

🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammed28s/NLP_AI.git
cd NLP_AI
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
python -m venv nlp-env
# On Windows:
nlp-env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source nlp-env/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download necessary NLP models:

bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger'); nltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker'); nltk.download('words')"
💻 Usage
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook
Open and run the notebooks:

NLP_Preprocessing.ipynb: For fundamental text cleaning and preparation.

Advanced_NLP_Analysis.ipynb: For NER, POS tagging, and analysis on the BBC news dataset.

📊 Results
The notebooks will demonstrate:

Preprocessing Impact: Cleaned and normalized text ready for analysis.

Entity Analysis: Visualizations of the most common people, organizations, and locations in the news.

Grammatical Insights: Trends in language use across different news categories.

Sample Output:

python
# NER Example Output
Text: "Apple announced its new iPhone in California."
NER: [('Apple', 'ORG'), ('iPhone', 'PRODUCT'), ('California', 'GPE')]

# POS Example Output
Text: "She quickly coded the solution."
POS: [('She', 'PRP'), ('quickly', 'RB'), ('coded', 'VBD'), ('the', 'DT'), ('solution', 'NN')]
